A positive result from a PCR is considered conclusive. A negative result on a PCR test may indicate that no infection is present or that the level of virus is too low to detect, as may happen if the test was performed after the 7-day window during which the virus is present in the sample collected for this test. A negative PCR result is followed by antibody testing (below).\"\n",
